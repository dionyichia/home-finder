**Notes on Mapping****

NPCs covering multiple areas:

- Woodlands West NPC is assigned to Woodlands, Mandai, and Sungei Kadut as it is the closest and most relevant.
- Nanyang NPC is assigned to Tuas, Lim Chu Kang, Pioneer, and Western Water Catchment due to its location in the industrial west.
- Orchard NPC covers multiple central areas like Orchard, Newton, and River Valley.

NPCs for urban centers:

- Marina Bay NPC is assigned to Downtown Core, Singapore River, and Southern Islands, where most major financial institutions and tourist attractions are.
- Rochor NPC is mapped to Rochor and Museum Planning Area since it is close to Bugis and Bras Basah.

Areas with no direct NPCs assigned:

- Areas like Central Water Catchment and Western Water Catchment are mapped to the closest NPCs in Woodlands and Nanyang, respectively.
